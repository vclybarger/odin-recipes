            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>⅔ cup unsweetened flaked coconut</li>
            <li>⅓ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>12 ounces uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey</li>
            <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
            <li>1 serrano chile, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>

    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Stir together flour and pepper in shallow dish. Lightly beat 
                eggs in a second shallow dish. Stir together coconut and 
                panko in a third shallow dish. Hold each shrimp by the tail, 
                dredge in flour mixture, and shake off excess. Then dip 
                floured shrimp in egg, and allow any excess to drip off. 
                Finally, dredge in coconut mixture, pressing to adhere. Place 
                on a plate. Coat shrimp well with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place 1/2 
                the shrimp in the air fryer and cook about 3 minutes. Turn 
                shrimp over and continue cooking until golden, about 3 minutes 
                more. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Repeat with remaining 
                shrimp.
            </li>

                Meanwhile, whisk together honey, lime juice, and serrano chile 
                in small bowl for the dip.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle fried shrimp with cilantro and serve with dip.
            </li>
        </ul>
