            <h2>Description</h2>
            This classic beef stroganoff recipe is a fairly lean 
            version, as most recipes call for more cream. 
            This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes.
            I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce
            to coat the meat. Serve over buttered noodles.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season beef generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until 
                    nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring 
                    constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid 
                    evaporates and meat browns.</li>
                <li>Remove meat from the pan and set aside. Stir 
                    mushrooms, onions, and butter into the pan; 
                    cook and stir over medium heat until 
                    vegetables are lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in 
                    flour; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until 
                    incorporated. Stir in wine and 1 cup of broth, 
                    scraping the bottom of the pan to release any 
                    browned bits. Bring to a simmer and cook until 
                    the sauce thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup 
                    of broth; bring to a simmer and cook on low 
                    heat for about 1 hour, covered, until beef is 
                    tender and sauce is thick. Stir every 20 
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in crème fraîche. Stir in chives. Season 
                    with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>
